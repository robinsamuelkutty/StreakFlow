Act as a Senior Full Stack Web Developer. I need you to scaffold and write the core code for a "Consistency Tracker" web application.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js 14+ App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI (for components).
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Server Actions).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase or Neon).
- **ORM:** Prisma or Drizzle.
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (v5) or Supabase Auth.

## Core Features
1. **User Authentication:** - Email/Password Signup & Login.
   - **Constraint:** Set the session strategy (JWT) 'maxAge' to 604800 seconds (7 days) so users stay logged in for one week.

2. **Smart Daily Dashboard:**
   - A minimalist view showing today's date, a quote of the day, and the top 3 priorities.
   - A summary widget showing the current "Consistency Score."

3. **Time Blocking Interface:**
   - A vertical timeline view (6:00 AM to 11:00 PM).
   - Users can drag and drop "blocks" of focus time.
   - Color-code blocks by category (e.g., Work, Health, Learning).

4. **Consistency Score Algorithm:**
   - Create a logic that calculates a score (0-100) based on:
     - Streak retention (multiplier).
     - Percentage of daily tasks completed.
     - Adherence to time blocks.

5. **Progress Visualization:**
   - A "Heatmap" component (similar to GitHub contributions) showing activity over the last 365 days.
   - A Line chart showing the trend of the Consistency Score over time.

## Database Schema (Prisma/SQL concept)
Please design the schema to include:
- **User:** id, email, password_hash, created_at.
- **Task:** id, user_id, title, is_completed, date, category.
- **TimeBlock:** id, user_id, start_time, end_time, label, color.
- **DailyLog:** id, user_id, date, consistency_score, notes.

## Design Requirements
- Dark mode by default.
- Use a clean, "bento box" grid layout for the dashboard.
- Responsive design (mobile friendly).

## Instructions
1. First, provide the **Prisma Schema** (schema.prisma) code.
2. Second, provide the **Authentication Configuration** file showing the 7-day session logic.
3. Third, create the **Dashboard Page** (page.tsx) with the bento grid layout.
4. Finally, write the logic for the **Consistency Score** calculation function.
